    Match `values` to `key_times` until there are no more `key_times` to
    left to match to.

    Key and value times provided are assumed to be in strictly ascending
    temporal order.

    Some key times may have no match that is within the tolerance given.
    In such a case, `None` is associated with the key time.

    The matching logic used is effectively greedy, however, the expected
    use-case is that of nanoseconds and with a tolerance that is significantly
    less than the normal distance between key times.

    :param key_times: Integer time values (usually nanoseconds) in ascending
        value order to match against.
    :param values: Reversible values to match against key times.
        These values should either be integer times themselves, be able to be
        associated to an integer via the `time_from_value_fn`. This reversible
        will be iterated over at most once.
    :param tol: Integer time matching tolerance.
    :param time_from_value_fn: Optional callable to provide a translation from
        the value type to the time (nanoseconds) of that object. By default, we
        consider the value *to be* the time.

    :returns: A list that is parallel in association to the `key_times`
        sequence. Slots may be valued with None (no match) or with a value from
        the `values` iterable. Values in this list should also be in relative
        ascending order.
