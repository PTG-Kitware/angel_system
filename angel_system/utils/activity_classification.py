    """
    Creates a simulated classifier prediction given the ground truth annotation
    file and the frame timestamps. The frame stamps are used to determine which
    activity was being performed in the ground truth file. By default, there
    is an artificial delay to simulate the classifier's computation time.

    The return type is consistent with the UHO's predict function.

    :param gt_file: string path for the ground truth annotations to use. It is
        expected that this is a feather file.
    :param frame_set_start_stamp: The start time in seconds for this frame
        window.
    :param frame_set_end_stamp: The end time in seconds for this frame window.
    :param predict_time: How long to delay returning the result to simulate the
        computation time the classifier would take.

    :return: A tuple consisting of two elements:
            0: Classifier results: A tuple consisting of a [1 x n_classes] tensor
               representing the classifier's confidence for each class and a tensor
               containing the index of the max confidence in the confidence tensor.

               indices to class strings.
