# Reference to the file defining the mean and standard deviation of the
# activity classifications to be used by the HMM. For N activities, both the
# mean and standard deviation should be N x N matrices such that when activity
# i is actually occuring, the classifier will emit confidence
# mean[i, j] +/- std[i, j] for activity j.

# Layout of the steps that define this task.
steps:
  # Item format:
  # - id: Identifying integer for the step.
  # - activity_id: The ID of an activity classification associated with this
  #                step. This must reference an ID within the `activity_labels`
  #                configuration file referenced above.
  # - description: Human semantic description of this step.
  # - median_duration_seconds: Median expected time this task will
  #                            consume in seconds.
  # - mean_conf: mean value of classifier confidence for true examples.
  # - std_conf: standard deviation of confidence for both true and false
  #             examples.
  - id: 1   # Must start at 1, 0 is reserved for background.
