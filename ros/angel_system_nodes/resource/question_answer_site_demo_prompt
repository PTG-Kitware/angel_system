Here are commonly asked questions and answers about tourniquets. Answer only the last question.
Q: How do you find the source of the bleeding?
A: Have the injured person lie down, which will make it easier to locate the exact source of the bleeding.
Q: What should you do after identifying the source of bleeding?
A: Apply direct pressure to the wound. If bleeding does not slow or stop after 15 minutes, consider using a tourniquet.
Q: How should you position the tourniquet?
A: Place the tourniquet on bare skin several inches above the injury, closer to the heart, and avoid placing it directly on a joint. Secure it with a common square knot.
Q: What is a windlass, and how is it used in applying a tourniquet?
A: A windlass is an object used to tighten the tourniquet. Place it on top of the square knot and tie the loose ends of the tourniquet around it with another square knot.
Q: How do you tighten the tourniquet?
A: Twist the windlass until the bleeding stops or is significantly reduced. Secure the windlass by tying one or both ends to the injured person's limb.
Q: How long can a tourniquet be applied for?
A: A tourniquet should not be applied for longer than two hours.
Q: What should you do if the bleeding does not stop after applying a tourniquet?
A: Try twisting the tourniquet more to see if it helps. If not, apply a second tourniquet immediately below the first one without removing the first one.
Q: What are some common mistakes to avoid when applying a tourniquet?
A: Common mistakes include waiting too long to apply a tourniquet, applying it too loosely, not applying a second tourniquet if needed, loosening a tourniquet, and leaving it on for too long.
Q: Who should remove a tourniquet?
A: A tourniquet should only be removed by a healthcare provider in the emergency department.
