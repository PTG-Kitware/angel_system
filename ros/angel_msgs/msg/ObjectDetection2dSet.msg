# A collection of 2D object detections predicted on a source 2D image.

# This message does not use ObjectDetection2D as a means of vectorizing
# components for efficient packing reasons.

# Box [left,right,top,bottom] origin is coordinate is the upper-left of the
# source image.

# Header frame_id should indicate the source these detections were predicted
# over.

# Prediction classification labels.
# Each detection in this set should have a confidence prediction for each of
# these labels, in the [0,1] range.
# If a detector does not yield a confidence for a label, then a 0 should be
# used for labels it did not predict.
string[] label_vec

# Number of detections contained in this set.
int64 num_detections

# Vector of detection axis aligned bounding box bounds coordinates.
# Each vector here should be of congruent length, where value `i` corresponds
# to the coordinate for detection `i`.

# This is a flattened 2D row-major matrix with shape:

# Vector length of each descriptor.
int32 descriptor_dim

# Flattened descriptor vector. The length of this list should be equal to

# Optional fields for Berkeley object detector.
# Each of these vectors is expected to be of length num_detections.
