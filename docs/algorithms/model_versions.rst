Iterations of Activity Detection and Object Detection Models
============================================================
Models described below have a "version tag" described for them, which is
intended to be a canonical identifier for that model instance.

Object Detection Models
=======================


Faster-RCNN Models
------------------

Baseline detector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version Tag: ``frcnn_vg_pretrained``

Out of the box detector pretrained on the visual genome dataset.

This model's weights as utilized in the system are currently stored on
data.kitware.com `here
<https://data.kitware.com/#collection/62cc5eb8bddec9d0c4fa9ee1/folder/6332f4dd11dab814282085e3>`__.
Reference implementation and pretrained model is from `here
<https://github.com/shilrley6/Faster-R-CNN-with-model-pretrained-on-Visual-Genome>`__.

Fine tuned on Berkley Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version Tag: ``frcnn_berkeley_coffee``

Baseline faster-rcnn detector trained on coco, then fine tuned on the object
labels provided by Berkley, which are comprised of objects from the PTG Coffee
recipe task.

Model weights are currently being trained and validated, eventually to be
located on data.kitware.com `here
<https://data.kitware.com/#collection/62cc5eb8bddec9d0c4fa9ee1/folder/64066cd97b0dfcc98f66ad11>`__.

Tourniquet Model Stage1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version tag: ``tourniquet_stage1``

MaskRCNN detector trained on BBN's M2_Tourniquet v0.52 YoloModel data.

This model's weights as utilized in the system are currently stored on
data.kitware.com `here <https://data.kitware.com/#collection/62cc5eb8bddec9d0c4fa9ee1/folder/64105f737b0dfcc98f66ba26>`__.

Tourniquet Model Stage2 with interstitial steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version Tag: ``tourniquet_stage2_interstitial``

MaskRCNN detector trained on the output of running the `tourniquet_stage1` model on BBN's M2_Tourniquet v0.52 videos. The input detections were
artifically adjusted by adding contact metadata and adjusting the
detection labels to include information about when the detction took place in relation to the task.

This model's weights as utilized in the system are currently stored on
data.kitware.com `here <https://data.kitware.com/#collection/62cc5eb8bddec9d0c4fa9ee1/folder/64105f737b0dfcc98f66ba26>`__.


Activity Classification Models
==============================

UHO Models 
----------

Baseline Faster-RCNN detector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version Tag: ``uho_baseline``

This UHO model was trained and validated on our own cooking data.
Hand features were generated from each hand pose using the Unified FCN model
(:file:`angel_system/uho/src/models/components/fcn.py`).
Object features were generated by passing each of our frames through the
``frcnn_vg_pretrained`` Faster-RCNN model (see above), and collecting the
features from the bboxes that were detected.

Model weights are stored on data.kitware.com `here
<https://data.kitware.com/#collection/62cc5eb8bddec9d0c4fa9ee1/folder/633b091e11dab81428208930>`__.

Fine tuned Faster-RCNN on Berkley data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version Tag: ``uho_berkeley_coffee``

This UHO model was trained and validated on our own cooking data.
Hand features were generated from each hand pose using the Unified FCN model
(:file:`angel_system/uho/src/models/components/fcn.py`).
Object features were generated by passing each of our frames through the
``frcnn_berkeley_coffee`` Faster-RCNN model (see above), and collecting the
features from the bboxes that were detected.

Model weights training is TBD.
