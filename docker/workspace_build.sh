# Standard advice is to perform builds before sourcing install setup scripts.
#
# Additional parameters are passed on to the underlying ROS workspace
# `colcon build` invocation.
#
# For additional debugging of build products, try adding:
#   --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
